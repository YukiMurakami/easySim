Bela is directly to the south of the Iranian countries of Bactria, Arachosia and Drangiana, to the east of the Iranian countries of Persia and Carmania and due west of the Indus River which formed a natural boundary between it and Western India. Following his army's refusal to continue marching east at the Hyphasis River in 325 BC, on his way back to Babylon, Alexander the Great crossed the area after sailing south to the coast of the Indian Ocean.
